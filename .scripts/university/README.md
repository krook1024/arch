# University scripts

These scripts are for managing my University notes and presentations. The
author of these scripts is @gillescastel, I've taken these scripts from
[this](https://github.com/gillescastel/university-setup) repo and modified them
to fit my needs.

You can read more about these scripts on his
[blog](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-3/).
